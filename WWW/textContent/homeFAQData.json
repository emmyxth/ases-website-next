    "question": "Is Bootcamp the only way to join ASES?",
    "answer": "Absolutely not! Bootcamp is one of many ways to get involved in our community. Students may join any of our teams (ex. Summit, Launchpad, VC3, etc), all of which enable participants to interact with our partners, meet potential co-founders, and learn more about the world of entrepreneurship. In fact, we strongly encourage students who already have a foundation in entrepreneurship or venture capital to consider other ASES programs (for example, Breakthrough might be a great fit!)."

    "question": "What's the difference between ASES, BASES, and SENSA?",

That's just our perspective though -- the best way to find out is to get in touch! You can reach us through the contact form below, our instagram account, our facebook account, or by reaching out directly to any of our leadership members!"

    "question": "What are some fun things the ASES community has done together?",

    "question": "What resources do ASES members gain access to?",
    "answer": "Some resources ASES members can take advantage of include...\n- Our 800+ member alumni network (including Garry Tan, David Lee, and Elain Szu). Our members go on to become founders, Thiel Fellows, VCs, engineers, business leaders, and more. It's not uncommon to see ASES alumni invest in the companies of other ASES alumni!\n- Partnerships with 20+ VC firms from around the world. ASES members gain access to an exclusive list of internships from these firms and portfolio companies, as well as office hours with the VCs to discuss potential ideas.\n- Mentorship and community. ASES ties run tight across generations and borders. We host a student-alumni mentorship program, monthly community events, and regular speaker series."

  {
    "question": "Can my time commitment to ASES vary quarter-to-quarter?",
    "answer": "Yes! Different programs require different time commitments. For example, VC3 planning and execution takes place primarily in winter quarter, leaving fall and spring open; Bootcamp runs across fall and winter, but spring is free. We recommend you get in touch with the specific program director(s) to learn more."
