I’ve met some of my best friends through the organization. It allowed me not only to explore what it means to be an entrepreneur outside of just Silicon Valley, but become a part of a close-knit community here at Stanford.",

Not only did I learn an incredible amount from knowing nearly nothing about entrepreneurship, I was sucked into a community of amazing people that extends around the world. I absolutely love my friends (family!) in ASES.",
